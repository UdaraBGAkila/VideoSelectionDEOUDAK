# Video Selection with Differential Evolution

We have 10 video files, each given with size and the play time.

Need to store them in a DVD, to maximize the playing time while the total size of the files not excluding 4500 MB.

## Representation Method 

Binary Representation

## Fitness Function 

Fitness Function = (Σ weights*playtimes) * f
Where {f = 1, (Σ weights*cdsizes) <= 4500
f = 0.5, (Σ weights*cdsizes) > 4500}

## Mutation operator – Differential mutation

Here new mutant vector which is called donor vector is generated by adding weighted difference between 2 two vectors to another vector from population. These are distinct vectors and not the target vector. But since binary representation used here, the values generated with the above cannot be used directly (since it generates values other than 1 and 0). So as an assumption, values which are neither 1 nor 0 are assigned 1 or 0 randomly.

## Crossover operator – Uniform Crossover

Here uniform crossover is performed between donor vector generated from above mutation and target vector and generates a vector called trial vector.

## Parameters

N = 10
F = 1
CR = 0.1
Iterations = 100 (1 run)
